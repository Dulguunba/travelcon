                <p>In summary, the best season to visit Mongolia for most travelers is summer (June to August) when the weather is pleasant, the countryside is lush, and outdoor activities abound. However, each season offers its own unique experiences, so the best time to visit ultimately depends on your interests and what you hope to see and do in Mongolia.</p>
